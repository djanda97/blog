### Jotting down a few reasons why I decided to start this site

* To act as a journal to catalog my thoughts as I gain exposure to different programming languages and computing topics
* To act as a creative outlet from both a technical perspective as well as an artistic one
* To act as a canvas for practing web design skills
* To act as a simple content management system for organizing various media that I consume, whether it be films, books, games, or music

### List of programming languages that I want to learn

* Backend/Server:
  * Go - via completing exercises from [*The Go Programming Language*](https://www.gopl.io/) book by Alan Donovan & Brian Kernighan

* Systems:
  * Zig - via completing exercises from the [ziglings](https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings) course
  
* Frontend/UI:  
  * Elm - via completing exercises from the [*Elm In Action*](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action) book by Richard Feldman

I intend to write posts about each of these topics as I work through the exercises mentioned above.
Another avenue to pursue to become more familiar with these programming languages would be to contribute to open source projects.
